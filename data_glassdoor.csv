Pay scales are based on your geographic location as well as experience so you are able to afford to live where you live. 
The health benefits and perks are the better than any other company I have found. 
Promotions are based on ones impact, not tenure, so everyone is hard working and cross functional relationships contribute to your efforts rather than hinder them.

Lack of career path and job options for positions outside of engineering.

Excellent health insurance 
Solid name recognition for future jobs
Top notch perks
","Leadership moves from crisis to crisis to crisis. The attention focus is relatively short on the hot issue of the moment and that trickles down to every org. You can be working on the number 1 goal or project from Jan - June and knock it out of the park. Then by July everyone's attention has shifted and your work is no longer relevant. A lot of institutional knowledge is lost this way. 

The company skews young as well, so there are a lot of inexperienced people who want to make their mark/get their promotions and they work hard but don't get the guidance that would help them work smarter. The result is that some teams take ""done is better than perfect"" and ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" to another level, which can make work tedious. Almost everyone comes from elite schools and has great stats so some really lean in extra hard into making themselves stand out, sometimes in ways that aren't the most useful or healthy. 

There's also a hierarchy Technical people on top, then Business people (cause they make the money) then lawyers then everyone else. People in ops often are at the bottom of the totem pole.

Transferring internally can be especially challenging, as there are no extra considerations for internal hires.

","- Large, convoluted teams. There are so many recruiting support teams that you don't know who to turn to for help at times. Also, there are times when I can manage something myself, but am forced to hand it over to a supporting team because it's ""their job"".

- They place a huge emphasis on doing recruiting projects. If you're not doing a recruiting project, forget about being promoted. Doing excellent recruiting and closing lots of roles is NOT enough. 

This emphasis on project work leads to people literally making up meaningless projects just to say they're doing extra work. It's a part of the culture that really needs to change.

You got gyms, an onsite dental / eye clinic, a massage therapist, an acupuncturist, access to campus Ubers and shuttles, the many many food cafes, sweet shops, food trucks, dry cleaning, Ship-It, a nail salon and barber shop, a bike rental/bike repair shop, and if you need to learn how to bike lessons, you can get that too. AR/VR, a print shop, ERO groups, life-style sessions, micro-kitchens - God I miss the micro-kitchens, the numerous off-site perks and discounts, the Dogs@FB Workplace group, the Tiger King@FB Workplace group, the Sad Meals WFH@FB Workplace group, no formal dress code, a park on the roof, ginger shots, Mark's weekly Q&A, other Q&As with various leaders and world experts, work from your desk or work from some random spot, the library, the product vending machine, the FB 15+ cause of how much you'll eat, the health benefits for a single person with no dependents, company stock and 401K, company products (Portal, IG, etc.), and company swag. Yes this is a real review and no I'm not being paid to vomit sweet nothings. In truth, I've never worked for anything like FB and I've worked for some top notch companies at different phases in my life. I love my team, my peers, my org, my leaders. I know it's going to be hard for me to find a replacement should I, someday, decide to leave FB. And while I realize FB isn't rainbows and unicorns cause it has issues, anytime you have people of different ages, genders, nationalities, political leanings, etc. in one place you're going to have issues but its pretty damn close to perfect. I'm over 40 (I feel 20) so I understand that for others my outlook may be a bit different and hell who knows in a few years I may feel different about the company. One thing though, I don't regret the interview loops nor my decision to leave another top tech org in the Bay area. I look forward to FB's evolution and seeing it continue to be successful.
","PTO is alright. The Performance Review process is stressful, feels like I'm prepping to take the SATs, GREs, LSAT or MCAT every 4 months. I'm saddened by the prospect that one day I may no longer view FB as a glorious place and like others pursue other shiny objects in hopes of making more money with less effort.

","It does feel like some employees demand too much from the company in terms of perks. I get the sense that whatever they have is never enough for them. 

The fast past environment can make you stress about your ability to succeed here. Everyone seems to have gone through those emotions though. 

When you're first starting off, it is very likely that you don't know what your job is and that you will spend the first few months trying to figure that out.

Outstanding internal tools, both software and hardware, for work and collaboration with colleagues around the world. Top of market pay, even before you count the benefits. Free food is just the beginning. Probably the most underrated perk is a free cell phone with international data roaming. (It's a corporate phone, but personal use is allowed within reasonable limits.)

Promotion cycles are twice yearly, more frequent than some other tech companies. Promotions come quick to top performers, who are lavished with ""refresher"" or ""additional"" equity awards.
","Exhausting performance review process. It feels neverending. Performance ratings are a bit too formulaic, and thus can be gamed to an extent; the system undervalues certain types of work (for example long-term, risky projects) that other companies would find valuable.

Traffic around the Menlo Park (MPK) HQ is atrocious. Parking is extremely constrained. Corporate shuttles are reliable and the route network covers a huge amount of the Bay Area and then some (there's even several daily shuttles to Santa Cruz) -- but the seats are often too narrow and uncomfortable. To give you a sense of the problem, most economy class airline seats are wider and more plush!

Facebook,"Mar 23, 2020 ", Software Engineer,"Cambridge, MA",Horrible terrible company with worst culture,"Free food, good salary, hype
","At Facebook I got to know what ""gaslighting"" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"". This is part of this culture! 
There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. 
Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. 

Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. 
HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. 

Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing. That people can treat each other like animals, given stack ranking. I wish I never joined this scam of a company, a lousy swamp filled with ghosts who pretend to be humans!

","Whoever does our PR honestly does an awful job. There are so many positive initiatives we partake in that I didn’t even know about, and I consider myself well informed. We are too silent when we’ve made a mistake and when we do issue a statement, it sounds stiff and insincere, and honestly doesn’t usually tell the story of how the mistake happened- we are humans building services for humans and we do try our absolute best

","- The company is too big and communications are valued far more important than technical skills. Impact focused culture makes the management rewards people who spent more time talking/writing docs, having meetings. It's getting more and more political. Hack culture is fading..

The challenge of moving fast enables everyone to adapt and learn fast. The product building process is state of art and people of most expertise are able to contribute to their fullest. If you are not a data engineer, you should consider joining Facebook.
","Data engineering role is not well defined. It lies somewhere between an Engineer and Data Scientist. This means data engineering is expendable and needed only in the most egregious of situations. In these situations, the kind of work you get to do is awesome. But in most other cases, DE's are doing grunt work. And DE managers are doing everything possible to show grunt work is great to satisfy the performance cycles.

Facebook,"Mar 1, 2020 ", Research Program Manager,"Menlo Park, CA",FB is ok. Pretty fed up with research operations.,"* Working at Facebook looks good on your resume
* I am never hungry
* Pay is ok for what the work is
","God help anyone who joins this team. The managers cant lead their way out of paper bag. One manager especially is gross. She backstabs and manipulates everyone. When called out for any bias they ignore it. Also a few months ago they decided to give everyone the Research Program Manager title, regardless of level or experience so now junior recruiting coordinators share the same title as people with M.B.A.s.. There is no support for your impact and only the favorites get recognized. Pulse scores won’t change anything. I can’t wait to leave and let the next poor soul be miserable in my place. Facebook is not a bad company I really just cannot stand this team. 

If anyone from HR is reading this, take a look at recent transitions/exits and notice the pattern for why people are leaving.
"
Google,"Aug 31, 2020 ", Software Engineer,"Mountain View, CA","Solid Experience, would work again","- Highly competitive pay, best benefits I've seen, best perks I've seen (yes, this doesn't matter, but when everything else is good, this helps).
- Very strong individuals. The average engineer here is very skilled and some of the best in the industry are here. This does not mean everyone is a genius, but there are certainly some here. To do the work, you definitely don't need to be the best, but the quality here is definitely among the best I've seen (I've worked at other ""top"" companies).
- Stellar work life balance. I've seen reviews for this that are negative, but I feel like they're on the wrong team or something. My team was busier than most and promoted people quickly and I still rarely pushed over 40 hours a week. I've seen some people work significantly fewer hours as well and still progressed. You can coast at L4 if you just do basic work and rest and vest.
- Good projects if you're on the right team. If you get lucky and get on the right team then the work is definitely interesting. This can be a con if you are on the wrong team.
- Interesting tools and learning opportunities. You can definitely learn a lot about system architecture if you are new to it. You can learn about any product area and go into the little details of that domain. Some tools at Google are used elsewhere and the knowledge can be transferred (Guice, Bazel, gRPC, protos, etc).
","- Work does not translate to other jobs. You never get to work on stuff like Apache Spark, AWS S3, RabbitMQ, and other technologies that are very common in industry. Instead you learn things like BigTable, which is similar to Apache HBase but not exactly. Your knowledge of internal frameworks is mostly useless in other jobs. The concepts learned are not, however.
- Half the projects are objectively boring and stale. Most of the projects are maintaining some aspect of the system (cloud, ads, etc) and a lot of it is tedious infrastructure work.
- Office politics as usual. The general population is friendly, but this does not mean everyone. Office politics definitely do play a role.

Google,"Aug 6, 2020 ", Content Strategist,"Mountain View, CA",Supportive work environment,"Work-life balance and work culture are some of the best things for me at Google. I spend very little time managing personalities and can instead focus on my work.

People are generally honest about feedback and criticism, but do it in a respectful and constructive way.

I've liked all managers, and have been able to make my own projects and priorities.

Started as a contractor for two years and was converted to full-time employee.
","Too many teams trying to do the same thing. The size of the company can make it challenging to get things done. Most projects require approvals from dozens of stakeholders with different priorities, and likely someone else is already working on the same project on a team you've never heard.

There's a paradox where collaboration is both necessary to get any project done, but also incredibly challenging. It requires you to navigate complex and overlapping org structures with simultaneous and competing priorities.

I don't blame the company for it, as it's a reality of working at any place this large.

Working at Google can be as good as it's painted out to be. When it's going well, it is by far the best job I've ever had.
","Managers play a huge role in your success and day to day happiness. Do you report to a good manager that you have a great relationship with? You're golden. Enjoy every minute of it. Unfortunately, Google has a tendency to do frequent and sometimes drastic reorgs. Sometimes this is helpful in turning a negative situation around. Other times it pulls the rug out from under workers with no other options given. Having a bad manager / team means the day-to-day is a struggle, promotions are hard to come by, and it's easy to get lost as another cog in the giant machine.

The work doesn't present many (if any) opportunities to do creative work - it's all about taking the safe option that offers consistent revenue. So in the end, you end up just repackaging the same set of solutions over and over again.

Google,"Jul 12, 2020 ", Software Engineer,"Mountain View, CA",Misogynistic. Toxic. Retaliatory.,"Money. That is the only pro.
","Google is the most toxic place that I have ever worked. Everyone is obsessed with levels. Yet, levels are largely determined by personal connections and stereotypes. I found out after I started that some employees had spent years researching the hiring system to game it. My coworkers were all significantly less qualified than my peers at prior jobs. My recruiter did not understand anything on my resume and pointed out that it was very different than all the resumes that she saw from entry level men. She assumed that meant that I was less qualified than them and never considered that I was far more qualified. She kept saying things that were horrifically sexist. She attempted to route me towards a non-technical position even after I had passed the interview and gotten approval from the hiring committee. The hiring processes are set up such that the recruiters determine someone's level and the interviewers and hiring committee cannot fix a mistake no matter how glaring. This results in some employees being underleveled. Most experienced women are underleveled by at least one level, but some are underleveled by multiple levels. Other employees are overleveled. This results in an entirely toxic culture. The underleveled employees are wondering what's wrong with them that their entire careers suddenly evaporated. The overleveled employees are extremely insecure and resort to bullying the underleveled employees (mostly women and people of color) because they know that they're less qualified than the underleveled employees. Even the managers who recognize what's happening are unable to fix the problems because HR is more concerned with covering up the problem. As a result, underleveled employees are being given work far below their competence level (because HR won't allow them to get higher level work) and told that they have to prove themselves again.su

Managers and team mates are respectful of work-life balance and even promote flexible work hours. The colleagues that I work with are all such nice people and I attribute that to the emphasis that the company puts on only hiring people that are Googley and how performance is partially measured on how well you work with others to accomplish a goal. Google Boulder in particular is fantastic with new office facilities, high quality (free) food, and a laid-back office atmosphere.
","Compared to my previous employers, the purse strings at Google are extremely tight when it comes to T&E. Many teams only have the budget to see their non-colocated managers and co-workers face-to-face one a year, which is a real shame and can be a huge productivity hindrance. This does not seem to be getting better YoY.

Training staff and process is incredible. I absolutely loved my time with Apple and they gave me an amazing opportunity to grow myself both personally and professionally.
","Degraded culture, little managerial discretion, entry-level employees get away with absenteeism and poor ethical performance. However much of this is due to the large size of the company and court rulings that favor poor performing employees because ""Apple is so big is can take the hit when an employee calls out repeatedly"" however what they fail to realize is that when 20% of the staff is calling out repeatedly, it impacts the customer experience and makes managing attendance a nightmare. Additionally, there is very little growth that has been occurring at Apple for the last 3-4 for years. Some entry level employees that have completed apprenticeships and proven they are managerial material have had little to no opportunities as there have been no openings.

Apple,"Aug 11, 2020 "," Int Designer, Senior User Experience Designer, User Experience Engineer","Cupertino, CA",Right for the wrong reasons,"- (subjective) As each of the 'most desireable' FANG companies has their own culture, Apple has theirs. Its a bit more low-key, professional and relaxed.
- after the initial shock of ""I work at Apple now"" fades away, work is work and your satisfaction/stress level will vary depending on your role, department, skill set and organization. I transferred between 3 different organizations - some very political, others like family. Sometimes within an org, 1 managers style (understanding, laid back - just expects quality work on time etc) would be a complete opposite of my coworkers under another manager (9-5 run like an agency)
- if you're ambitious there is opportunity - but also know there is a sautés quo and you are taking a risk. its up to you whether or not its worth it.
- looks great on your resume
","Alot of politics, I've seen entire agencies brought in for single projects where the end result was scraped. I've seen managers hire relatives and Apple outsources their 'investigations' department who get paid by how many people they accuse of violating policies.

","Unfortunately, it's still retail - customers can be challenging to work with, and there's a high level of engagement required on the daily. This isn't a job for people who like to coast.

*Job stability at corporate
*Smart & some kind people if you look for them
*Good on your resume
*Opportunity to develop your political skills and patience
","*Incredibly hard to onboard (& everyone reminds you about this regularly) beyond superficial stuff like IT & basic corporate tasks, especially during COVID. *So so many 10++++ year or ""I've only worked at Apple"" people. Apparently there's an ""Apple Way"" to do things but there's also little documented so hard to figure out what that means. 
*Related there's a wide belief that Apple is somehow particularly special (in a way that doesn't prove out imo) & there's an arrogance that goes along with it. This is not a company that values humility or listening.
*Unbelievably siloed based on function & product. Most organizations & even the next level teams might as well be separate companies.
*Your experience will vary incredibly based on which organization & which team you end up on. Ask a lot of tough questions about that during the interviews. What characteristics are valued?
*Your experience will also vary incredibly based on your manager so do your due diligence & insist on a lot of time talking to the manager before you accept a job at Apple.
*Not a company that feels fun or where a sense of humour seems valued. Yes COVID complicates this but we are all still human not robots.
*A lot of time spent talking in committees that go nowhere.

Apple,"Jul 6, 2020 ", Operations Program Manager,"Cupertino, CA",Truly special and unequaled company that taught me an immense amount and changed my life,"• Incredible culture and drive to be and do the best at everything. Steve's simple yet powerful vision ""to make the greatest products in the world"" really did deliver.
• Special place to be and work alongside some really great and talented people. I was there for 8yrs and to this day have life long friends and trusted colleagues.
• IF you performed and achieved results, you could be compensated handsomely. This was obviously even more dramatic the earlier you joined (I joined around the time of the 1st iPhone). 
* Honestly, I miss so much about Apple despite it being my choice to leave. There was so much greatness there but I had to expand my horizons and in doing so have passed on immeasurable amounts of experience I gained while at Apple.
","• Like any organization, there were some true jerks. They were somewhat few and far between but upper management did not see this clearly and HR was not good about dealing with them EVEN when there were multiple points of feedback. I had a Director that was such a jerk that it caused me physical health issues not to mention the emotional and stress toll. Luckily I was young and could take this, but MANY people quit or tapped out, I watched it happen somewhat frequently. That said, these horrible experiences were balanced out by some incredible leaders who to this day set the bar for me. 
• Tons of travel can really wear on you. If you get good at it, you can manage it, but nothing is like being home consistently. The good news is the travel is somewhat by choice -- once you prove yourself you can move around internally to minimize this -- and it's comfortable (good airline seats, good hotels, good food, good people).
• Career growth is challenging since there are so many motivated, driven, capable people. Even when you believe -- and others tell you -- that you are a stand-out performer and leader, there's always jockeying for roles and it can be exhausting and demotivating.

Apple,"May 15, 2020 ", Embedded Software Engineer,"Cupertino, CA",Great company with a culture that takes getting used to,"One thing I’ve learned from talking to people within Apple is your experience will greatly vary, depending on your organization. I’m a software engineer in the Core OS organization within SWE, so my review only applies to that.

People outside Apple like to poke fun when senior leadership publicly says they’re trying to be customer-centric and “do the right thing” while making decisions that go in to products. After being here, I truly believe that is the case! Tim and Craig have proven to be very thoughtful, honest and effective leaders

We work on some tough technical problems and some really innovative technology.

At the end of the day, as an individual contributor I am enabled to put my head down and do my best work. Apple can be demanding, expect to receive emails and pings on nights and weekends. You have to learn to set boundaries and stick to them. If you enjoy your work, like I do, it’s very easy to accidentally put too many hours in
","As with lots of tech companies, there are many different personalities to deal with and some can make your job miserable. It sounds like being in middle management is extremely political and there are management movements / re-orgs pretty often.


Apple culture can be difficult to navigate for some. There’s very little documentation (this is improving), and the company is entirely built on making relationships and hallway conversations. This can make working in remote offices difficult, from what I’ve heard. Introverts beware!

They tend to focus on the one negative customer who left a net promoter survey for unrealistic expectations while ignoring the dozens of other customers who scored you a top score. Conversations begin with ""What could you have done better?"" while ignoring the multitudes of customers who scored you high. Plus, apple doesn't promote managers from within.

Apple,"Apr 9, 2020 ", Software Engineer,"Sunnyvale, CA",Here are the bad things,"Great pay, great benefits and you have Apple on your resume.
","Reviews are accurate, all of the bad ones at least. They use a lot of OFFSHORE contractors, and high percentage are not good, same for the managers, they used to be not so good contractors and are managers now.

Is not usually bad to use contractors due to the flexibility of scale up and down on people, but when you have 5 employees and 15 contractors and they just come and go, you don't really have that flexibility, it's the same 15 positions but filled but people that are taken to extreme burn out and writing code and creating designs worst than recent grads. Engineer quality is the worst I've ever seen in my life overall with 18 YOE. Are there good folks there? Yes, absolutely, but when you have 5 employees and 15 contractors and 50% suck and are OFFSHORE in India on a completely different timezone you are in for a mess and a career hara-kiri. 

Unless you are making much less than the current TC offered, I would advise against it. It doesn't matter the team, trust me on that, I have experienced and interacted with several teams, it's all the same. If TC is significantly higher take it, and leave soon to similar paying company. I'm looking for my way out.

All the contractors are from Tata Consulting and Infosys, those guys are suffering and being exploited. 100% of the people I've interacted with are Indians, diversity is 0%, it's incredible, you feel like you are in India yourself, never seem this in my life and I've worked in all the MAGAF.

","This best thing about this job was the pay and the team members. After 6 months they start switching you around like clothes to other managers and groups. During winter and summer, full time is a huge pain because you literally work from home but can’t spend time with your family on the holidays since most of your day is taken by this job. The customers are ruthless, rude and use vulgar language this company cares more about what angry biased customers think than the employees. Most of your job performance is based on people that either don’t like the companies policies and give you a bad review or people asking you to take out a magic wand and grant their “impossible” wish. The managers are big on favoritism and they start tearing you apart once you let them know they can’t control you like the rest of the team. The tier 2 advisors and disgusting as well and take every chance to make you feel dumb for trying to do your job or not knowing something. This job starts off well but ends up to be a circus based off of how high you can jump to make the customer happy. The 8 hour shifts are grueling and having a kind customer was very rare for me. Being in college and dealing with a job like this was absolutely stressful and they don’t care for you to have a life. The hours to take off are limited and they literally try to penalize you for taking off WITHOUT pay when there are literally no more hours left to put in! The pay was always good but not all money is good money because this job is very stressful and has a lot of surprises that come up along the way. This job only sees you as a robot that should take verbal abuse from higher management and customers, no one should have to experience what I have from this job so please choose wisely.

The pay is way more than the average college student receives from an hourly job. The company is flexible and they give out free things all the time. On numerous occasions, I would get a package from Apple and it would be a free gift and I would never realize I was getting it. Also, the discount is pretty awesome especially on their services.

Health insurance is top tier with nominal premiums.
RSUs, ESPP, EPP+, discounts on cell services, discounts with retailers and lots of other perks. 
Gym reimbursement if you don’t work on any of the campuses, bike reimbursement, or pays for commuter services.
The company is there for their employees during natural disasters, etc. 
Free legal advice if you’re going through matters outside of work.
Free therapy sessions if needed throughout the year. 
So many free or highly discounted services and products provided to us. 

In addition, the amount of opportunity for growth to corporate is unparalleled. If you leverage a career experience or mentor ship well enough, there’s no way you won’t open doors to corporate. (from a retail level)
","At the retail level, it’s turned into a “good old boy” hierarchy. Market team leaders being brought in from clothing or big box retailers, hiring all their old buddies as lower leadership. It’s how our retail culture is being lost. Positive intent only thrives within employees that are considered “legacy” thinkers. And “legacy” thinkers don’t get promoted. Work/Life balance does not exist within Apple Retail, even for part timers. 

At the corporate level, it’s a scramble to fill positions. So we’ve hired so many people that aren’t top tier talent anymore. Friends hiring friends for the sake of friendship, instead of how they can actually perform. Pay is also not as competitive as other companies in SF/Bay Area/San Jose. 

They don’t like hiring from within for management positions. There are some really great employees and people that I worked with that should’ve been management a long time ago, but they’re quickly passed over.

-Pay was fair for the work

Apple,"Mar 6, 2020 ", AppleCare Senior Technical Advisor,"Miami, FL",Fantastic Benefits; Incredibly Difficult to Get Promoted,"Benefits are amazing. 
Pay is incredible but if you do not get promoted, you will eventually pay cap.
","Pay cap is frustrating due to lack of open positions for advancement.
Consistently mishandles employee development into management. 
Hires from outside for some management positions

","New technologies keep coming, sometimes with errors. Many people will be confused with its very unique programming culture when you support those app developers .

Apple,"Mar 3, 2020 ", Technical Specialist,"Orlando, FL",Best company I have worked for,"Great company culture, they truly do value their employees and try to make it known. Best work environment I have worked in. There is opportunity to grow, learn, and move up as long as you are committed to that goal.
","Even as a part time employee, work-life balance is hard to achieve for some reason. It can very easily and quickly begin to feel like you are there all day every day.

Nice pay considering it’s a retail position 
Good company to have on resume

Full time is very hard to achieve since almost everybody wants it
REALLY entitled customers can cause a headache

Apple,"Mar 1, 2020 ", Specialist,"San Antonio, TX",Micromanagement with a PR team to make people think otherwise.,"The benefits are great. Pay is so-so
","They micromanage metrics at every level. Its said it’s not a sales job but it absolutely is. You have to sell their services from AppleCare+ to Apple Arcade (which is a joke). And if you are 1% off of your metrics you get talked to. They justify it stating that this is a “for profit” company. Duh! All companies want to make a profit and I think Apple is doing just fine in terms of profit.
